# Static Analysis Results

## Tool: STACY - Stacks Static Analyzer for Clarity

[STACY](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/stacy) is an open-source static analyzer for Clarity smart contracts developed by CoinFabrik. It identifies common security issues and best practice violations in Clarity code, helping developers write more secure and robust smart contracts.

STACY checks for vulnerabilities like:
- Unsafe tx-sender usage in assertions
- Block height used incorrectly for time tracking (Critical)
- Context loss in contract calls (Critical)
- Division before multiplication causing precision loss (Critical)
- Improper error handling (unwrap-panic usage)
- Reentrancy issues
- Arithmetic issues
- Authorization control weaknesses
- Unused private functions and arguments
- Variables that could be constants
- Deprecated function usage
- TODO comments left in code
- Other Clarity-specific security concerns

## Analysis Results

Run - stacy-analyzer lint tests

====== Linting c:\Users\mattb\Projects\sburn\contracts\sburn2.clar... ======      
No issues found.

## Conclusion

The contract successfully passed all STACY static analysis checks, indicating:
- No detected security vulnerabilities
- Adherence to Clarity best practices
- Proper error handling and authorization controls

This clean analysis provides a solid foundation for continued development and helps ensure contract security.
