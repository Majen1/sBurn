# sBurn Token Testing Results

## Overview of Testing Approach

This project uses a comprehensive testing approach that combines traditional unit tests with advanced property-based testing techniques:

### Unit Tests
Traditional unit tests verify specific behaviors with predetermined inputs and expected outputs. They're good for validating basic functionality and specific edge cases.

### Property-Based Testing with fast-check
I used the `fast-check` library to perform property-based testing, which goes beyond unit tests by:

1. **Fuzzing**: Automatically generating hundreds of random inputs to test functions, helping discover edge cases a developer might not think of.

2. **Property Tests**: Instead of testing specific input-output pairs, you can test that certain properties always hold true regardless of input. For example, "a transfer should always increase the recipient's balance."

3. **Invariant Tests**: These verify that certain conditions always remain true throughout the system, like "total supply must always equal effective supply plus burned tokens."

This approach helps catch subtle bugs that might only appear with certain combinations of operations or unusual inputs. It's especially valuable for financial contracts where unexpected behavior could have serious consequences.
