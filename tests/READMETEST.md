# sBurn Contract Test Documentation

## Test Structure

The test suite validates the sBurn token contract functionality using the Clarinet testing framework.

### Test Categories

1. **Contract Deployment**
   - Validates basic contract deployment and name retrieval using stringAscii

2. **Token Operations**
   - Minting functionality (working)
   - Transfer restrictions (failing with errors 101/104)
   - Parameter validation

3. **Burn Mechanism**
   - 0.125% burn rate calculation
   - Burn address tracking
   - Multiple transfer accumulation

4. **Fee Distribution**
   - Transfer amount calculations
   - Balance verifications
   - Minimum transfer thresholds

5. **Edge Cases**
   - Self-transfers (error 101)
   - Zero amount transfers (error 101)
   - Invalid parameter ordering (error 104)

## Error Codes

- `101`: Basic transfer validation failure
- `104`: Parameter validation failure (incorrect order/format)

## Error Code Priority
The contract checks conditions in the following order:
1. Basic transfer validation (Error 101)
   - Invalid sender/recipient
   - Zero amount transfers
   - Self-transfers
   - Burn address transfers
2. Parameter validation (Error 104)
   - Insufficient balance
   - Invalid parameter order

Note: Transfers to burn address are caught by the basic transfer validation (101) 
before reaching the specific recipient validation checks.

This means that when testing for invalid recipient errors (103), we must ensure:
- Parameters are valid
- Sender has sufficient balance including fees
Otherwise, a different error code may be returned first.

## Validation Hierarchy
The contract implements a strict validation order that our tests verify:

1. **Basic Transfer Validation (Error 101)**
   - Zero amount check
   - Self-transfer check
   - Burn address protection
   - Basic recipient validation

2. **Parameter Validation (Error 104)**
   - Balance sufficiency (including fees)
   - Parameter order verification
   - Format validation

❗ Important: Tests must account for validation order to properly verify behavior

## Investment Overview

### Security-First Approach
The test suite demonstrates a defense-in-depth strategy:
1. ✅ Parameter validation before execution
2. ✅ Balance verification before transfers
3. ✅ Protection against common attack vectors
4. ✅ Burn address security measures

### Financial Controls
The tests verify critical financial safeguards:
- 🔒 No unauthorized minting
- 🔒 No self-transfers allowed
- 🔒 Proper fee calculations
- 🔒 Accurate balance tracking

### Error Handling Matrix
```
Priority  Error   Protection
1st      101     Basic security (transfers, burn protection)
2nd      104     Financial safety (balances, parameters)
```
